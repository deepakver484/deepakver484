## Projects

* ### [Airbnb Scheduling Forecast](https://github.com/juniorcl/airbnb-scheduling-forecast)

    To help the booking of the Airbnb this data science project aim to create a machine learning model to predict the first booking of a new user. Unfortunately the database is very desbalanced which difficult the prediction of the model, the best result was 17.48% +/- 0.4% of accuracy. Therefore new approaches guided by the business will be necessary to improve the results.
